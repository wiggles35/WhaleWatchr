# WhaleWatchr

Making getting home easier!
The idea for this project is to allow parents a way to input their childs going home plan after school, rather than having to call the school. It includes an admin view to accept or deny requests, and a parent view to manage their childrens' after school schedule.

This project is built using React Native, Django, and SQL
